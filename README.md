## Description

> ü§ì A project by **Soilianmang Thangsing** | **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/theofficialsoi)** | **[Github](https://github.com/soithangsing)** | **[Portfolio](https://blissful-clarke-77b2ef.netlify.app/)**

This blog allows an author to create, update and delete blog posts and categories from the GraphCMS system.

This is my first **full-stack web application** and also my first time using technologies like Tailwind, React, Next.JS and GraphQL. Using these technologies made me appreciate Tailwind Classes and exposed me to the sheer potential in full-stack web development.

Some challenges that I faced were with the .tsx file format not executing normal JS commands properly (which I fixed by changing them back the files back to .js) and several failures during deployment.
